Assignment: Build an app using the Themoviedatabase APIâ€™s to show popular movies currently. The app should display posters of top 10 movies. When user selects a movie from the list, the app should show details of the movie.
API : Head over to https://developers.themoviedb.org/ and register as a developer to get the API Key. After that use popular movies API call to fetch the movies. To get the movie details use get movie details API call.
Technical details: Use the following

* Kotlin
* Retrofit
* Picasso/Glide
* Architecture Components (LiveData, Flow etc)
* Coroutines

As I have not used Kotlin very much before and I have never used Retrofit/Picasso/Architecture Components before, then initially I'm going to use Java, then figure out how to replace at least one of the Java callbacks to a coroutine.
